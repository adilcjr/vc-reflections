1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you need to keep data safe and keep a history for changes.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because the remote repository could have some changes that you don't need to merge with yours. 

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork you use when you would like to take some code and use, change and you don't think in share your progress to author.
	Clone you could help and share your modifications with the author.
	Branches you use to make some changes like fixes or different versions of the same project.
