===========

1) How did viewing a diff between 
two versions help you spot the bug?

It's easy to find the differences 
and spot the bug when you compare 
two versions of the same file.

2) How could having easy access to 
the entire history of a file make 
you a more efficient programmer in 
the long term?

You could learn with your mistakes
and find bugs more fast.

3) What do you think are the pros 
and cons of manually choosing when 
to create a commit, like you do in 
Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google Docs?

When you have automatic saves its hard 
to find a bug in a big file. Because 
you have a lot of differences shown.
The problem with manual commits is that 
you need to remember to do this action.

4) Why do you think some version control 
systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like 
Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think they are different point of views.
Google Docs was designed to create
documents and you don't really break a
document with a change in another document.

5) How might using version control make you 
more confident to make changes that could 
break something?

I'm not so confident about this. I prefer to use test
driven development to don't break the code.

6) Now that you have your workspace set up, 
what do you want to try using Git for?

I would like to use Git to control my code changes.
